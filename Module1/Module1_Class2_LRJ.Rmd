## Preliminaries

First we load the packages that we will be using in this document.  It's good practices to load packages as the beginning so they are all in the same place.  If you decide later you need an additional package, add it to the top of the document!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # core group of tidyverse packages
library(kableExtra)  # to make nice tables
```

## Module 1: Smoking and the risk of disease

Questions of interest:

* **Question 1.1: ** How does the risk of disease compare for smokers and otherwise similar non-smokers?

<center>
![](Q1_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

* **Queston 1.2: ** Does the contribution of smoking to the risk of disease vary by sex or socio-economic status (SES)?

<center>
![](Q2_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

To address each question we want:

* A data display (graph or table)
* A statistical analysis (with interprepration)

We will answer these questions using data from the National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES)

## Discussion of NMES data displays for Question 1-1

As we look at these displays, think about these questions:

* What are the characteristics of effective displays?
* How can the current displays be improved to answer our question of interest?

                           labels=c("Male", "Female")),

  count(age_cat, female, eversmk, lc5) %>%
  group_by(age_cat, female, eversmk, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%

         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")))

  count(eversmk, lc5, educate, poor) %>%
  mutate(prop=n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(lc5 == "LC")

## R notes based Assignment 1-1

### Recoding variables

Since we aren't sure which variables we will be using to make our plots and fit our models later, we want to recode all of the variables of the data set rather than just the variables we will use in our data display.

Remember that this is our codebook:

* `age`: age in years
* `female`: 1=female, 0=male
* `eversmk`: 1=has ever been a smoker, 0=has never been a smoker
* `current`: 1=current smoker, 0=not current smoker
* `former`: 1=former smoker, 0=not former smoker, NA if eversmk=0
* `packyears`: reported packs per year of smoking (0 if eversmk = No
* `yearsince`: years since quitting smoking (0 if eversmk = No)
* `totalexp`: self-reported total medical expenditures for 1987
* `lc5`: 1=Lung Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer or COPD, 0=none of these
* `chd5`: 1=CHD, Stroke, and other cancers (oral, esophageal, stomach, kidney and bladder), 0=none of these
* `beltuse`: 1=Rare, 2=Some, 3=Always/Almost always
* `educate`: 1=College grad, 2=Some college, 3=HS grad, 4=other
* `marital`: 1=Married, 2=widowed, 3=divorced, 4=separated, 5=never married
* `poor`: 1=Poor, 0=Not poor

At the beginning of your .Rmd file, you should recode **ALL** of these variables to have meaningful labels.
```{r}
nmes_data <- read_csv("./Module1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(eversmk = factor(eversmk, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Never smoker", "Ever smoker")),
         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")),
         chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No CHD", "CHD"))
         )

#etc, fill in the rest of appropriate variables here
```

### Combining LC and CHD into a single disease variable

If we really want to talk about the risk of **disease** where disease can be either LC or CHD, we want to combine into a single disease category.  This is what we called *major smoking-caused disease*, MSCD, in Public Health Biostatistics.

Here we will create a new variable based on `lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD"`, which stands for `lc5 == "LC"` OR `chd5 == "CHD"`.  The `|` symbol means that only one of the conditions needs to be true in order for the whole statement to be true.  So basically, if either a person has LC OR a person has CHD, we will designate them as having a diease.

```{r}
nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD", 
                          levels=c(FALSE,TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No disease", "Yes disease")))


# We can take a look at the combine variable with the two individual variables
nmes_data %>%
  count(disease, lc5, chd5)
```

## Review of logistic regression

In Public Health Biostatistics, we asked the question: 

**Is the infant mortality risk (or odds) higher for twins than singleton births?**

We could answer this question using a 2x2 table:

|         | Singleton| Twin| Total|
|:--------|---------:|----:|-----:|
|Survived |      8899|  187|  9086|
|Died     |       526|   71|   597|
|Total    |      9425|  258|  9683|

In this case:

* Odds of death for twins: 71/187 = 0.38
* Odds of death for singletons: 526/8899 = 0.059
* Odds ratio of death for twins as compared to singletons: $$OR = \frac{odds \ for \ twins}{odds \ for \ singletons} = \frac{71/187}{526/8899} = 6.42$$
* Log odds ratio: $log_e(OR) = log(6.42) = 1.86$

We could also answer this question using logistic regression:

$$log(odds \ of \ death) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot twin$$

$$twin = \left\{
\begin{matrix}
1 & if \ twin\\
0 & if \ not \ twin
\end{matrix}
\right.$$


```{r}
nepal_data <- read_csv("./Module1/nepalData2019.csv")
model1 <- glm(death ~ twins, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nepal_data)
summary(model1)
exp(coef(model1))
```

From this output we can interpret as follows:

* $1.86 = \beta_1 = \log(OR)$
* The log odds of death, comparing twins to singleton births, is 1.86.
* $6.41 = e^{1.86} = e^{\beta_1} = OR$
* The odds of death for twins is 6.42 times the odds of death for singleton births.
* The odds of death is 542% higher for twins than for singleton births.

We also asked: 

**Does the odds of death increase with increasing gestational age?**

$$\log(odds \ of \ death) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (gestational \ age)$$

From this equation:

* $\log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 41 \ weeks) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (41)$
* $\log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 40 \ weeks) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (40)$
* Difference:
$$\log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 41 \ weeks) - \log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 40 \ weeks)$$
$$= (\beta_0 + 41\beta_1) - (\beta_0 + 40\beta_1) = \beta_1$$
* Log odds ratio:
$$\log(OR) = \log(\frac{odds|ga=41}{odds|ga=40})$$
$$= \log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 41 \ weeks) - \log(odds \ of \ death | ga = 40 \ weeks) = \beta_1$$
* Odds ratio: $OR = e^{\log(OR)} = e^{\beta_1}$

```{r}
model2 <- glm(death ~ gestage, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nepal_data)
summary(model2)

exp(coef(model2))
```

From this output we can interpret as follows:

* $-0.1367 = \beta_1 = \log(OR)$
* An additional week of gestational age is associated with a decrease of 0.14 in the log odds of death.
* $0.87 = e^{-0.1367} = e^{\beta_1} = OR$
* An additional week of gestational age is associated with a 13% decrease in the odds of infant death.

**How could we account for any possible confounding variables in a logistic regression analysis?**

* We could include potential confounding variables as covariates in our analysis using multivariable logistic regression:

$$\log(odds \ of \ death) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (gestational \ age) + \beta_2 \cdot twin + \beta_3 \cdot male$$
* We interpret the regression coefficients in a multivariable model as **ceteris paribus** -- holding all other things equal
* $\beta_1=\log(OR)$ for a one-unit change in gestational age, **holding twin status and sex constant**
* $\beta_2=\log(OR)$ comparing twins to singleton births, **holding gestational age and sex constant**
* $\beta_3=\log(OR)$ comparing male infants to female infants, **holding gestational age and twin status constant**

## Assignment 1.2
